Primary improvement: The primary improvement is a modified ballistic-diﬀusive equation (BDE) model incorporating a temperature jump boundary condition and specularity parameter to characterize thermal transport in graphene field-eﬀect transistors (GFETs) with ultrashort channel lengths.

Specific problem: The paper aims to address the challenge of thermal management and stability in nanoscale transistors, particularly in the context of increasing temperatures due to miniaturization.

Approach: The authors used a modified BDE model derived from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). This model includes a temperature jump boundary condition at the oxide-graphene interface and incorporates the Ziman specularity parameter to account for phonon-boundary collisions.

Materials: The study focuses on GFETs with a single-layer graphene (SLG) channel on a SiO2 top-gate dielectric.  The dimensions of the GFET are taken from existing literature, with a 10nm channel length. The paper introduces a novel modification to the BDE model by incorporating the temperature jump boundary condition and the Ziman specularity parameter to better describe phonon-boundary scattering in nanoscale transistors. No novel fabrication processes or materials are introduced.

Key findings include: Validation of the proposed BDE model against experimental and computational data from the literature. Demonstration that graphene FETs are more thermally stable than silicon MOSFETs with the same channel length. Observation of a temperature jump at the oxide-semiconductor interface due to phonon-boundary scattering. Higher heat dissipation ability of GFETs compared to Si MOSFETs. The impact of specularity parameter on temperature: higher specularity leads to lower temperature rise.

Metrics: The main performance metric evaluated is the peak temperature rise along the channel of the transistors. Heat flux is also analyzed.

Advantages: The proposed solution, using GFETs, offers advantages over existing silicon MOSFET technology due to graphene's excellent thermal conductivity and low energy consumption, leading to enhanced thermal stability and higher heat dissipation.
