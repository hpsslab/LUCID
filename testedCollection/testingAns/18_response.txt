Primary improvement: This paper demonstrates a technique for contacting individual on-surface synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as electrodes, enabling the electrical characterization and observation of quantum transport phenomena in individual GNRs.

Specific problem: Contacting individual on-surface synthesized GNRs, particularly long ones, for device applications is challenging due to their small size and the limitations of conventional lithographic techniques.  Existing methods often bridge multiple GNRs, hindering the study and exploitation of single GNR properties.

Approach: The authors used self-aligned SWNTs as electrodes to contact individual GNRs in a multigate device architecture.  This approach leverages the small diameter of SWNTs (around 1 nm) and the aligned growth of both SWNTs and GNRs on their respective substrates.

Materials: 9-atom wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons (9-AGNRs) synthesized on Au(788) substrates. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) grown on quartz substrates. SWNTs transferred onto a substrate with pre-patterned Cr/Pt finger and side gates covered with a 30nm Al2O3 dielectric layer. Nanogaps (15-25nm) created in the SWNTs using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching. 9-AGNRs transferred onto the device substrate with SWNT electrodes using an electrochemical delamination method. The use of self-aligned SWNTs as electrodes for contacting individual on-surface synthesized GNRs in a multigate device architecture is a novel approach.  The electrochemical delamination method for transferring GNRs is also relevant to the fabrication process.

Key findings/results: Successful contacting of individual 9-AGNRs with SWNT electrodes. Observation of quantum transport phenomena including Coulomb blockade, excited states of vibrational origin, and Franck-Condon blockade, indicating single GNR transport. Demonstration of individual gate control over GNR and SWNT conductivity. Determination of electron-phonon coupling strength in the GNR junction. DFT calculations supporting the experimental findings and attributing excited states to vibrational modes.

Metrics: Differential conductance (dI/dV). Addition energies (ranging from 33 to 110 meV). Excited state energies (around 23-25 meV). Electron-phonon coupling strength (λ around 2.65). Gate coupling strengths (αFG:αSG1:αSG2 = 1.00:0.81:0.29 for one device). Electronic coupling between GNR and SWNT electrodes (4.9-7.7 meV)

Advantages: Enables contacting of individual, long GNRs, which is difficult with existing lithographic techniques. Multigate architecture allows for individual control of GNR and SWNT conductivity. SWNT electrodes offer smaller contact area compared to graphene or metal electrodes, improving the precision of contacting individual GNRs.
