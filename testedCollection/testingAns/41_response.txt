Primary improvement: Demonstration of ultraclean Ohmic van der Waals contact between indium (In) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), clarifying the atomistic origins of its Ohmic-like transport properties.  Achieved by low-temperature deposition of In.

Specific problem:  Creating reliable Ohmic contact between metals and TMDCs, which is challenging due to the Fermi-level pinning effect.  Specifically, clarifying the origin of low contact resistance in In-MoS2 contacts.

Approach:  Fabricated In/MoS2 contacts with a cooled substrate holder during In deposition. Characterized the interface with TEM, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements. Performed DFT calculations to understand the atomistic mechanisms.

Materials:  Few-layer and monolayer MoS2 flakes on h-BN flakes deposited on SiO2/Si substrates.  In electrodes deposited via thermal evaporation with a cooled substrate holder (~100 K).  Au/MoS2 contacts fabricated for comparison. The key novelty lies in the cooled substrate holder during In deposition, leading to an ultraclean van der Waals interface.  No novel materials are introduced.

Key findings/results: Atomically clean In/MoS2 interface achieved with minimal metal-induced defects. Small interfacial charge transfer between In and MoS2. Ohmic-like transport behavior observed over a wide temperature range (2.4 K - 300 K), attributed to field emission. Low contact resistance achieved (~600 Ω μm for few-layer MoS2 and ~1000 Ω μm for monolayer MoS2 at cryogenic temperatures). DFT calculations reveal large in-gap states due to In-MoS2 hybridization, facilitating Ohmic charge injection.

Metrics: Contact resistance, Schottky barrier height, field-effect mobility, sheet resistance, on/off ratio, specific contact resistivity.

Advantages:  Lower contact resistance compared to traditional metal contacts, achieved through an ultraclean van der Waals interface and field-emission-dominated transport.  Reduced Fermi-level pinning due to minimal charge transfer.
